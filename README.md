NoSQL/MongoDB Challenge - Bootcamp Module #12

Introduction:

In this challenge, we were tasked with importing a database and it's associated collection via mongoimport. After creating the database, I made updates to the database and performed various queries. I also modified data types. Then I performed varoius analysis using filter commands and converting data to pandas dataframes.

Setup Starter Code:

Used MongoImport to import the database and the assorted collections. I made updates to the database by creating a dictionary and inserted the new data into the collection. Next, I performed various search and find operations, counted the documents and deleted some others. Finally, I modified data types to the correct values.

NoSQL Analysis Code:

For this portion, I performed various analyses including identifying specific documents with various parameters and using count_documents built-in function. Then I converted the results to pandas dataframes.
